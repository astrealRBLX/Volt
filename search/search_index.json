They are used to manipulate control flow in an easy and user-friendly manner. They are essentially just module scripts. That's it. The only difference from a normal module script is that Volt knows how to read these module scripts and execute their code in a way that makes your development workflow significantly smoother. Executable Creation # You can store your executables anywhere. It's recommended you create an individual folder to group your executables. Let's say you are creating a Money executable to handle player money. First you would create a folder called Money then within that folder create two module scripts. One for the server and one for the client. To help distinguish them within the explorer you should append .Server or .Client to their names. However, Volt doesn't read your executable names and this is entirely personal preference. Tip Stay organized!
